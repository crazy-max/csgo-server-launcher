```
mkdir: cannot create directory "/var/steamcmd": Permission denied

It's because you are on a 64-bit architecture and you have to to install the 32-bit libraries:

```
apt-get install -y libc6-i386 lib32stdc++6 lib32gcc1 lib32ncurses5 lib32z1
```

> :warning: Replace lib32ncurses5 with lib32ncurses6 on Debian buster based distros
